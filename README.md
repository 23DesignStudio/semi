## Platform IO
source code created by Platform IO IDE

- nodemcu32s_solar: use solar panel as optical sensor
- nodemcu32s_steppermotor: use TB6600 driver and nodemcu32s to control stepper motor
- nodemcu32s_steppermotor_v2: include a potentiometer as input to control motor and send/recevie cmds to/from Unity  
- oc_pc817_4sw: use 4 photocouplers as switch to control bloon machine
## Unity

It's about bidirectional communications between Arduino and Unity. Serialport is the main protocol and implemented by Unity plugin Ardity.
